1) Program to print numbers and calculate the sum using loops:
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
print("Numbers from 1 to", n, ":")
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print(i)
sum_numbers = 0
counter = 1
while counter <= n:
    sum_numbers += counter
    counter += 1
print("Sum of numbers from 1 to", n, "is:", sum_numbers)

2) Program with a user-defined function to calculate the square:

def calculate_square(n):
    return n ** 2
num = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
square = calculate_square(num)
print("The square of", num, "is:", square)
